# simplenight-POC-PabloMeseguer

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the development of a test automation framework using **Playwright**, following best practices and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. The framework is designed to execute **UI and API tests**, ensuring high-quality validation with detailed reporting.

This project is integrated with **Allure** for rich test reports and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD execution, allowing automated validation on each push or pull request.

## Repository

GitHub Repository: [simplenight-POC-PabloMeseguer](https://github.com/meseguerjp1/PabloMeseguer_playwright_Challenge_Simplenight)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/meseguerjp1/PabloMeseguer_playwright_Challenge_Simplenight.git
   cd PabloMeseguer_playwright_Challenge_Simplenight
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```sh
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

# Running Tests

You can execute different types of tests using the following commands:

## Run all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Run all tests with Allure reporting:
```bash
npm run test:report
```

## Run tests in headless mode:
```bash
npm run test:headless
```

## Run tests in headed mode (with UI visible):
```bash
npm run test:headed
```

## Environment Specific Tests

### Run tests in Development Environment (headless mode):
```bash
npm run runTestDevEnvironment:headless
```

### Run tests in Development Environment (headed mode - with UI visible):
```bash
npm run runTestDevEnvironment:headed
```

### Run tests in Production Environment (headless mode):
```bash
npm run runTestProduction:headless
```

### Run tests in Production Environment (headed mode - with UI visible):
```bash
npm run runTestProduction:headed
```

## Viewing Allure Reports

To generate and view the Allure report after running tests:

```bash
npm run test:report
```

This command will:
1. Execute all tests.
2. Generate an Allure report.
3. Automatically open the report in your browser.

## Notes:
- Headless mode runs tests without opening the browser (faster for CI pipelines).
- Headed mode runs tests with browser visible (useful for debugging).
- Allure reports are automatically saved under `allure-report/` folder.
- Make sure you have Allure Commandline installed to generate and view reports properly:
```bash
npm install -D allure-commandline
```
